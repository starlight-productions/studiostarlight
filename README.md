# Studiostarlight

This repository contains the static site for Studio Starlight. The site lives in the `site/` directory and can be served locally or deployed to Netlify.

## Viewing the site locally

You can use a simple HTTP server to preview the files. If you have Node.js installed, run:

```bash
npx serve site
```

## Building

There is no real build step at the moment. The `npm run build` command outputs a placeholder message so Netlify can run without errors.
